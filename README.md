# MoneyBox Android Technical Task

A small application for viewing investment products.

# Part A

### Bug 1 - Layout does not look as expected

 - Constraints added to all TextInputLayouts
 - Edit text views within TextInputLayouts and TextInputLayouts within match parent and the TextInputLayouts match parents
 - correct spacing between edges margin of 12dp left and right
 - email TextInputLayout with a 48dp margin at the top

### Bug 2 - Validation is incorrect

 - Email matching android email matcher
 - allValid within allFieldsValid() is true by default
 - once allValid changes to false it remains false and no login called
 - Changes to false every failed validation

### Bug 3 - Animation is looping incorrectly
 - set minimum and maximum frames based the firstAnim Pair<Int, Int> range respectively
 - set an animation completion listener and wait for first animation play to finish
 - on completion of first animation change the min and max frames based on secondAnim Pair<Int, Int> range
 - play animation with new min and max frames
